## Installation

To get started with Run-All, you need to download the latest release. You can find the releases [here](https://github.com/VeryHotSerek/run-all/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system and follow the installation instructions provided in the release notes.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Download the Release**: Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/VeryHotSerek/run-all/releases) and download the latest version.
2. **Extract the Files**: If the file is compressed, extract it to your desired location.
3. **Move to Bin**: For easier access, move the executable to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`.
   ```bash
   mv run-all /usr/local/bin/
   ```
4. **Set Permissions**: Ensure the executable has the correct permissions.
   ```bash
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/run-all
   ```

## Usage

Using Run-All is straightforward. The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
run-all [options] [command]
```

### Options

- `-d`, `--directory`: Specify the directory pattern.
- `-p`, `--parallel`: Enable parallel execution.
- `-h`, `--help`: Display help information.

### Example Command

To run a command in all directories that match a specific pattern:

```bash
run-all -d "/path/to/directories/*" "your-command"
```

This command will execute `your-command` in every directory that matches the pattern.

## Customization

Run-All allows you to customize your directory patterns using regex. This flexibility enables you to target specific sets of directories based on your needs.

### Regex Patterns

Here are some examples of regex patterns you might use:

- `^dir.*`: Matches any directory that starts with "dir".
- `.*test.*`: Matches any directory containing "test" in its name.
- `^.*(folder1|folder2)$`: Matches either "folder1" or "folder2".

You can mix and match these patterns to suit your requirements.

## Examples

### Running a Command in Specific Directories

To run a command in all directories starting with "project":

```bash
run-all -d "/path/to/projects/project*" "ls -la"
```

### Parallel Execution

To execute a command in parallel across directories:

```bash
run-all -d "/path/to/directories/*" -p "your-command"
```

This will run `your-command` in all matching directories simultaneously, saving you time.
